message = " Two apes are walking down a path toward the nearby river.  It is a beautiful 
            day and they wanted to do something nice with the day.

            As they get half way down the path, the area around them begins to change color
             to a reddish orange.

            'Awe!' The male ape yells as the light surrounds them.

            'Shok!' Awe yells as she sees him rise from the ground.
             The light begins to retreat as Awe watches Shok being carried away in
             the beam of light.  She continues to watch as the beam retreats 
             into the nearby laboratory with Shok.

            'I am coming for you, Shok,' she says passionately as she heads
            toward the laboratory.
